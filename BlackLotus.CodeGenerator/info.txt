STATUS:
Working on TypeGenerator. It's now fetching all the types from the solution.

In order to create a new query we need the following files created:

1. <Domain>.Infrastructure
- Folder of domain (e.g. Equipments)
	- Folder QueryModels
		- Folder Models (model has to be added to the <domain>DataConnection.cs)
		<modelname>.cs
	<subdomain>QueryModel.cs --> Interface + class. Check if they already exist and add query to this file. If it does not exist, create dataconnection etc.
- Databasemodels (**)
- Querymodel (**)
- 



** can already exist

Input:
- domainname
- subdomainname
- queryname
- models (from table or view)


domainname is for example Inventory
subdomainname is for example Equipments
